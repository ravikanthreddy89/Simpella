Simpella
=======================================================

A peer-to-peer application with file share, search and download capabilities. It is based on Gnutella protocol version 0.6.
The language used is java.

1) What our program does ?
   - Listens to incoming tcp connections from other servents
   - user (one who executes this program) can connect to other servents using TCP, can query the application
     to enumerate the existing outgoing/incoming connections 
   - user can search the Simpella network for files
   - user can query the information of the host(the one on which the application is being executed)
   - user can query the simpella network statistics like
       1) No of bytes received and sent
       2) Messages received and sent
       3) Queries received and sent
   
      Note : The messages sent/received can be viewed for all the connections or individually
    - user can download files from other servents
   - 
2) The commands implemented
     - info 
         all the options specified were implemented       
    - share
    - scan
    - open
    - update
    - find
    - clear
    - list
    - download
    - autoconnect

Note : 1) An extra command "autoconnect" is implemented. This command forces the servent to search for new Simpella hosts in the 
          network and to establish a simpella connection to them. 
       2) Command has to be invoked explicitly by the user.
       3) After invocation of this command makes sure the servent has two outgoing connections.
